Define one interface you think is appropriate in this healthcare project, that has a method that takes a String argument.
Then a class, that implements this interface.
Then a demo class that creates one object of the above class and invokes that method.

interface DoctorAvailable {
    String doctorName;
    void display(String doctorName);
}

class DoctorToday implements DoctorAvailable {
    String doctorName;  
    public void display() {
        System.out.println(doctorName);  
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DoctorToday dr = new DoctorToday();
        dr.doctorName = "Dr.Parth";
        dr.display();
    }
}
